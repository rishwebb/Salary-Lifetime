## 💎 Design System & Highlights
- **macOS Studio Aesthetics**: Frosted glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`), deep obsidian black background (`#060709`), and high-contrast electric lime-yellow-green accents (`#dcf836`).
- **Authentic Apple Details**: macOS window chrome with functional traffic lights (close, minimize, zoom) and sticky top menubar with real-time Cupertino clock.
- **Strictly Zero Emojis**: Every interface icon, indicator, and category symbol is a hand-crafted Apple-style vector SVG.
- **100% Mobile Responsive**: Tested across mobile viewports (iPhone/Android) with zero horizontal overflow, fluid touch scrolling, and adaptive layouts.
